# Creating First Django Project

First we need to cd "change direct" to our folder

```py
cd folderName
```

go to your terminal and type django-admin

```py
django-admin
```

now you can see you have bunch of list of django, we use the **startproject** command

```py
django-admin startproject yourname
```

- using the _"manage.py"_ we can serve the server, run the website,

```py
python manage.py runserver
```

now you go to your localhost and see your first website
